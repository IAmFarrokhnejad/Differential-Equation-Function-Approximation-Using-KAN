# Differential-Equation-Function-Approximation-Using-KAN
 
## Todo:
- Get this reference: https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/computingengineering/article-abstract/20/6/061004/1082608/Solution-of-Biharmonic-Equation-in-Complicated
- Algorithm optimization for V 0.1
- Fix the bugs in V 1.1.1 .
- Add the references that cited the initial work.
- Convert all base codes to jupyter.
- Explore all useful subtypes of KAN (references 7, 8, and 9) to figure out whether they can prove useful for our examples or not.

### Important References:
- Useful subtypes of KAN: 7-9
- KAN for ODE: 18
