## V 2.0:
- Same as V 2.3 in Jupyter codes, however, this library builds the architecture using torch so the optimization strategies will differ for this code.


## Accomplishments/Discoversies:
- V 2.0, is extremely weak, however, the network actually learns on longer runs. With proper optimizations, it might outperform the pyKan version.
